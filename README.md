## Model Building for 2 problems
* <b>Titanic Dataset</b><br>
Examine the Titanic dataset. Predict who survived or not?

* <b>Customer Churn Project</b><br>
A marketing agency has many customers that use their service to produce ads for the client/customer websites. 
They've noticed that they have quite a bit of churn in clients. 
They basically randomly assign account managers right now, but want to create a machine learning model that will help predict which customers will churn (stop buying their service) so that they can correctly assign the customers most at risk to churn an account manager.
Create a classification algorithm that will help classify whether or not a customer churned.
Then the company can test this against incoming data for future customers to predict which customers will churn and assign them an account manager.
